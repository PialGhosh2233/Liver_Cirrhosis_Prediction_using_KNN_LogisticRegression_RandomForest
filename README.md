### Cirrhosis Stage Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting the stage of cirrhosis based on clinical features. The dataset, sourced from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/cirrhosis-prediction-dataset

#### Project Overview

Cirrhosis is a liver disease characterized by abnormal liver function due to chronic liver damage. Effective prediction of cirrhosis stages can aid in better management and treatment strategies for patients. This project utilizes Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest classifiers to model and predict the stages of cirrhosis from clinical data.

#### Data Description

The dataset includes the following features:
- Biochemical parameters like Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Albumin, etc.
- Demographic data such as age and sex.
- Clinical data such as the presence of ascites, hepatomegaly, and edema.

#### Key Steps in the Analysis
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest to predict the cirrhosis stage.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing models based on accuracy and using confusion matrices for detailed performance analysis.
- **Result Visualization:** Comparing the performance of different models visually.

#### How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.

```bash
